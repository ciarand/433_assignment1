Cipher
======

Notes
-----
Because the Playfair cipher (`ciphers/playfair.py`) doesn't handle repeated
letters or 'X's very well (i.e. it's a "lossy" cipher), our unit tests are set
to report false if there's a discrepency between the original plaintext and the
generated plaintext of more than 10% (measured per-character).

Tests
-----

  sure you're getting it for `python3`, not `python2`)
. `cd` into the project directory
. Run `virtualenv .`
. Run `bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Run `bin/py.test cipher_test.py`
